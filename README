Behave.js - real unit-testing for JavaScript
============================================

Goals:
- Don't try to run tests asynchronously. Unit-tests don't need to run
  asynchronously.
- Make it really easy to create test files and suites
- Target node and the browser
- Have jMock-style mocking built-in
- Have tools for stubbing callbacks
- Be as much RSpec-like as possible

Make it easy to test asynchronous JavaScript synchronously!

What we have:
- ability to run suites with nesting describes on node.js
- before_each hook that runs before each test (can be nested)
- "spec" style result reporter with color output

Todo:
- callback stubbing
- mockery
- "dots" reporter
- test runner for the browser

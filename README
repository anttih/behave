Behave.js - synchronous unit-testing for JavaScript
===================================================

Goals:
- Don't try to run tests asynchronously. Unit-tests don't need to run
  asynchronously.
- Make it really easy to create test files and suites
- Target node and the browser
- Have jMock-style mocking built-in
- Have tools for stubbing callbacks
- Be as much RSpec-like as possible

Make it easy to test asynchronous JavaScript synchronously!
